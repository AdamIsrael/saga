# saga

## New Project

```bash
saga new novel foo
cd novels/foo
saga compile draft
```

## Templates

Templates must create the same folders:
- Draft
- Outline
- Research

The contents of those folders can be customized for the template, though.

Saga will look for these folders when compiling manuscripts.
